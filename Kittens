  <p>Hi! I’m Lily, the person behind <strong>Lily’s Posh Finds</strong>.</p>

  <p>This shop is more than just a place to find cute fashion — it’s also a way for me to give back. Every week, I donate part of my proceeds to help support kittens in need, including supplies like food, litter, toys, and cozy bedding for fosters and rescues.</p>

  <p>I’ve always had a soft spot for animals, and since starting this shop, I’ve made it part of my mission to use it as a small force for good. If you’ve ever bought from me — thank you. You’ve helped a kitten somewhere stay safe, fed, and warm. 🐱💗</p>

  <p>I’m based in <strong>Martinsville, VA</strong>, and I also offer local pickup for those nearby. Feel free to <a href="index.html#contact">reach out</a> if you’re interested in learning more about the kittens I support or just want to say hi!</p>
